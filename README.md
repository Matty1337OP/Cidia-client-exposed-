# Cidia-client-exposed-

Exposing a client called Cidia made by goose 

I used to dev this shit but i quit after i was underpaid Goose can code but he likes pasting from his old clients and being a dick
1. he didnt even give me panel access
2. he removes alot of the shit i work on with his own stuff 
3. he sides with A person that dosent even code only protects the client
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He claims its the best SO here is what it has 
A speed witch he talks proudly off even tho its a normal ground strafe speed with boosts u a bit and dose a 80% strafe on dmg
His antivoid just uses blink with some other stuff and funny packets to work 
Dosent let me see the autoblock and no slow as he takes it out every time he pushes a update so i cant see it 

He can code and is skilled but hes just a dick person that puts no trust into me at all
